# 📘 HBNB Projet Part 1 - Documentation

## 📚 Introduction

This document provides an overview of the layered architecture employed in the HBnH project, highlighting the separation of concerns across different layers and the key entities involved. This document will delve into the specifics of each layer, the entities they manage, and the design decisions that underpin the architecture.

## 📦 Package Diagram

This diagram illustrates a layered architecture for the HBnB project, utilizing interfaces and design patterns to separate concerns across three main layers:

````mermaid 
classDiagram
class PresentationLayer {
    +ServiceAPI
}
class BusinessLogicLayer {
    +User
    +Place
    +Review
    +Amenity
}
class PersistenceLayer {
    +DatabaseAccess
    +Repository
}
PresentationLayer --> BusinessLogicLayer : Facade Pattern
BusinessLogicLayer --> PersistenceLayer : Database Operations
````

### 🏗️ The 3 layers

- **PresentationLayer (User Interface)**: Interacts with the business logic through the `ServiceAPI` interface, abstracting the implementation details from the user.
- **BusinessLogicLayer (Business Logic)**: Contains core business entities: `User`, `Place`, `Review`, `Amenity`.
- **PersistenceLayer (Data Persistence)**: Manages data access and storage via `DatabaseAccess` and `Repository`.

### 🧩 Entities

- **User**: Represents a platform user.
- **Place**: Represents a lodging or property.
- **Review**: Represents user reviews for places.
- **Amenity**: Represents available amenities in a place.

## 📊 Class Diagram

This section provides an overview of the key classes in the HBnB project, detailing their roles, key attributes, and relationships. This will serve as a reference for implementing robust and scalable business logic.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        - string first_name
        - string last_name
        - string email
        - string password
        - boolean is_admin
        + register() void
        + update_profile() void
        + delete() void
    }

    class Place {
        - string title
        - string description
        - float price
        - float latitude
        - float longitude
        - User owner
        - List<Amenity> amenities
        + create() void
        + update() void
        + delete() void
        + list() void
    }

    class Amenity {
        - string name
        - string description
        + create() void
        + update() void
        + delete() void
        + list() void
    }

    class Review {
        - int rating
        - string comment
        - User user
        + create() void
        + update() void
        + delete() void
        + list_by_place() void
    }

    User --* Place : "User can have multiple places"
    Place --* Amenity : "Place can have multiple amenities"
    Place --* Review : "Place can have multiple reviews"
    Review --* User : "Review is associated with one user"
```

### 👤 Class: User

**Role**: Manage users.  
**Key Attributes**: first_name, last_name, email, password, is_admin.  
**Methods**: register(), update_profile(), delete().  
**Relationships**: A user can own multiple places (Place).

### 🏠 Class: Place

**Role**: Represent an available place.  
**Key Attributes**: title, description, price, latitude, longitude, owner.  
**Methods**: create(), update(), delete(), list().  
**Relationships**: 
- A place belongs to a user.
- A place can have multiple amenities (Amenity).
- A place can receive multiple reviews (Review).

### 🛠️ Class: Amenity

**Role**: Manage amenities associated with a place.  
**Key Attributes**: name, description.  
**Methods**: create(), update(), delete(), list().  
**Relationships**: Associated with one or more places.

### ⭐ Class: Review

**Role**: Collect reviews for a place.  
**Key Attributes**: rating, comment, user.  
**Methods**: create(), update(), delete(), list_by_place().  
**Relationships**: 
- A review is linked to a place.
- A review is written by a user.

### 🔑 Key Decisions

**Structure**:  
Each entity is autonomous with CRUD methods for management.

**Relationships**:  
Aggregations (e.g., User → Place) facilitate navigation while maintaining low dependency.

**Extensibility**:  
CRUD methods ensure easy scalability in case of adding new features.

## 🔄 Sequence Diagram
